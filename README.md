# Overview 
There are different kinds of microorganisms can be found on different types of human body. Among those bacterias there are certain types of bacteria that are found on belly buttons of hunmans have the ability to synthesize the protein which tastes like beef. To study this finding further Roza conducted an experiment by studying on humans belly button across the world. The volunteers for the study are anonymous and each are given an id number.

## Purpose 
The purpose of the project is help roza build a dashboard which can visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer from the. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. 

 **To help Roza make Dashboard I used the following languages/sources.**
- JavaScript
- Plotly
- css
- html
- D3.js
- data source: Samples.json

## Results 
On the dashboard when the individualâ€™s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage it displays the demographic info of that volunteer, bar-chart, bubble-chart and gauge chart.
